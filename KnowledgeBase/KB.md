What I2C bus is?
------------------------------------------------------------------

The I2C (Inter IC) bus was designed by Philips in the early '80s to allow easy communication between components which reside on the same circuit board.

Most significant features include:

- Only two bus lines are required
- No strict baud rate requirements like for instance with RS232, the master generates a bus clock
- Simple master/slave relationships exist between all components
- Each device connected to the bus is software-addressable by a unique address
- I2C is a true multi-master bus providing arbitration and collision detection
